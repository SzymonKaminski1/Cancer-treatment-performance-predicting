# ML project
This project is about choosing best model for predicting cancer medicine perfomace. Data set consists of variables containing information about cancer genes expression and a variable 'Y' showing medicine effect. 'Y' values are in [0,1] interval and the lower 'Y' value is the better medicine is performing.__
Train and test data is stored in: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ADea54376PHXMwRHeteK6h4kqqPxS5af?usp=sharing __
There were three models I had to check: Lasso, ridge regression and random forest. For checking Lasso and ridge regression I used Elastic Net method, and for random forest I used 500 variables with highest coefficient of variation.
